# ASP.NET & Entity Framework TestBed

### A very basic set of projects that are specifically relating to features I'm testing before I go about adding
### it to a full-project.

## Basic Project Structure

* libTestBed is the EntityFramework, specific, library/bindings.
* webTestBed45 is the ASP.NET 4.5 web application for version 4.5.  I try to use specific controller names to deal with/test specific functionality.
* webTestBed5 is the ASP.NET 5 web application.  It works with Rosyln.

## Problems Solved, and where to find them.

* FileTable Support - If you're working with uploads, FileTables is one such option to handle the uploads.  The negative of this method is that you're bound to using a specific database backend.  To some, this may matter.  Still, given the benefit of using entity framework for the CRUD-operations related to file uploads, it is worth looking into.  This problem is worked on through libTestBed, and webTestBed45 (controller: filetable).
